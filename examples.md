<h3>Workshops</h3>
<h4>CAR's Health Impact Assessment (HIA) Workshop - 2021-12-08</h4>

<p>As part of this workshop there was a complete <abbr title="Health Impact Assessment">HIA</abbr> example of the long term burden of PM2.5 in Perth and greater WA. All of the code and data for this presentation are made available on CoESRA. 
Instructions for accessing these data can be found here: </p>

<p>An example of a <abbr title="Centre for Air pollution, energy and health Research Data Analysis Technology">CARDAT</abbr>
workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Research project</strong>: what is the research question that you would like to analysis and who you will be working with.</li>
<li><strong>Data discovery and acquistion</strong>: are the datasets you need available in the data inventory catalogue? If not, find the data elsewhere, 
but consider providing it to <abbr title="Centre for Air pollution, energy and health Research Data Analysis Technology">CARDAT</abbr> for publication so 
that it can be available to others. If the data you want is in the <abbr title="Centre for Air pollution, energy and health Research">CAR</abbr> Data Inventory 
then access it (or request permission to access it if it is restricted).</li>
<li><strong>Data analysis</strong>: use either a <abbr title="Collaborative Environment for Scholarly Research and Analysis">CoESRA</abbr> workstation, 
or your own computer to analyse the data (see <a href="why_use_cardat.html">here</a> 
to help assess if using <abbr title="Collaborative Environment for Scholarly Research and Analysis">CoESRA</abbr> is useful to you).</li>  
<li><strong>Save scripts and analysis</strong>: document and save the scripts used in your analysis. If this is done in <abbr title="Collaborative Environment for Scholarly Research and Analysis">CoESRA</abbr>, then the 
work can be accessed by others. These scripts should ideally be kept with the output of data so that the workflow
is transparent and reproducible.</li>
<li><strong>Syncronise data as you go</strong>: data can be syncronised with CloudStor or <abbr title="Collaborative Environment for Scholarly Research and Analysis">CoESRA</abbr> as you go, this makes it easier to
have a single master copy of the data.</li>
<li><strong>Publish outcomes</strong>: publish the results of your analysis. Don't forget to acknowledge the data using the citations
in the data inventory, and to link to the scripts used to create the data.</li>
</ol>
