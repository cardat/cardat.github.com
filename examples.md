<h3>Workshops</h3>
<h4>CAR's Health Impact Assessment (HIA) Workshop - 2021-12-08</h4>

<p>As part of this workshop there was a complete <abbr title="Health Impact Assessment">HIA</abbr> example of the long term burden of PM2.5 in Perth and greater WA. All of the code and data for this presentation are made available on <abbr title="Collaborative Environment for Scholarly Research and Analysis">CoESRA</abbr>. 
Instructions for accessing these data can be found here: </p>

<p>An example of a <abbr title="Clean Air Research Data Analysis Technology">CARDAT</abbr>
workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Research project</strong>: what is the research question that you would like to analysis and who you will be working with.</li>
<li><strong>Data discovery and acquistion</strong>: are the datasets you need available in the data inventory catalogue? If not, find the data elsewhere, 
but consider providing it to <abbr title="Clean Air Research Data Analysis Technology">CARDAT</abbr> for publication so 
that it can be available to others. If the data you want is in the <abbr title="Centre for Safe Air">CAR</abbr> Data Inventory 
then access it (or request permission to access it if it is restricted).</li>
<li><strong>Data analysis</strong>: use either a <abbr title="Collaborative Environment for Scholarly Research and Analysis">CoESRA</abbr> workstation, 
or your own computer to analyse the data (see <a href="why_use_cardat.html">here</a> 
to help assess if using <abbr title="Collaborative Environment for Scholarly Research and Analysis">CoESRA</abbr> is useful to you).</li>  
<li><strong>Save scripts and analysis</strong>: document and save the scripts used in your analysis. If this is done in <abbr title="Collaborative Environment for Scholarly Research and Analysis">CoESRA</abbr>, then the 
work can be accessed by others. These scripts should ideally be kept with the output of data so that the workflow
is transparent and reproducible.</li>
<li><strong>Syncronise data as you go</strong>: data can be syncronised with Cloud CARDAT or <abbr title="Collaborative Environment for Scholarly Research and Analysis">CoESRA</abbr> as you go, this makes it easier to
have a single master copy of the data.</li>
<li><strong>Publish outcomes</strong>: publish the results of your analysis. Don't forget to acknowledge the data using the citations
in the data inventory, and to link to the scripts used to create the data.</li>
</ol>
