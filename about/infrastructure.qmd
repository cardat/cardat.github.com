As per the above diagram, there are three aspects of this system:

- a cloud based data storage system [Cloud CARDAT](https://cloud.car-dat.org)
- a catalogue of available datasets [CAR Data Inventory](https://cardat.github.io/data_inventory/index.html)
- an online data analysis platform [CoESRA](https://coesra.tern.org.au/)
- GitHub repository with tools <https://github.com/cardat/>

An overview of the CARDAT IT infrastructure can be seen in the [attached](files/IT_infrastructure_overview.pdf) overview document.

Access to these systems is administered through the [CARDAT Data management team](mailto:car.data@curtin.edu.au).
