<h2>Why use <abbr title="Centre for Air pollution, energy and health Research Data Analysis Technology">CARDAT</abbr>?</h2>
<hr class="car-red" />
<p>There are several advantages to using <abbr title="Collaborative Environment for Scholarly Research and Analysis">CoESRA</abbr> and Cloud CARDAT</p>
<ul>
<li><abbr title="Collaborative Environment for Scholarly Research and Analysis">CoESRA</abbr> offers a secure working environment which is accessable from any web browser.</li>
<li>It offers the ability to analyse data remotely, removing the need to synchronise or download large datasets locally.</li>
<li>For those who want to run analysis locally, Cloud CARDAT offers the ability to download and synchronise datasets locally. 
This greatly reduces the risk of confusion over which copy/version of the data is being used.</li>
<li><abbr title="Collaborative Environment for Scholarly Research and Analysis">CoESRA</abbr> allows your desktop analysis 
environment to be configured. This feature enables you to choose how much <abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr> you need and how many cores you would like 
- this can be very useful for using R with large datasets (as R keeps its objects in memory), and for optimising parallel computations.</li>
<li>It provides an easy way to work collaboratively on the same files, even across organisations. Accessing the same files prevents issues 
with multiple versions and master copies.</li>
<li>There are a range of pre-installed technologies for manipulating data (preventing issues with software versions and dependencies).</li>
<li>Data analysis can be done in a reproducible and transparent way, and as it is stored on an online platform, it can be used as for
publishing data and workflows for journal articles.</li>
</ul>
