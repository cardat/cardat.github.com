<h2>Welcome to <abbr title="Centre for Air pollution, energy and health Research Data Analysis Technology">CARDAT</abbr></h2>
<hr class="car-red" />
<p>
The Centre for Air pollution, energy and health Research (CAR) Data Analysis Technology (DAT) is a collection of IT infrastructure
that enables easy data sharing and reuse, and reproducible data analysis.
It is an online research platform that collates a wide array of population, health and environmental datasets
with a collection of analysis tools and methodology resources. The data in <abbr title="Centre for Air pollution, energy and health Research Data Analysis Technology">CARDAT</abbr>
includes air pollution, weather and built environment data in Australia and internationally. 
This platform enables collaboration between researchers and policy makers.
</p>

<p><abbr title="Centre for Air pollution, energy and health Research Data Analysis Technology">CARDAT</abbr>'s mission is to provide data, methods and tools to support <abbr title="Centre for Air pollution, energy and health Research">CAR</abbr> 
to inform policy though research and analysis of air pollution, energy and health.</p>

<h3><abbr title="Centre for Air pollution, energy and health Research Data Analysis Technology">CARDAT</abbr> Infrastructure</h3>
<p><abbr title="Centre for Air pollution, energy and health Research Data Analysis Technology">CARDAT</abbr> is a group of online technologies and data management tools for storing, accessing, and analysing datasets that are useful for epidemiology. The major components can be seen in figure 1 below.</p>
