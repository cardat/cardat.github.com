"],["data-inventory-model.html", "1.1 Data Inventory Model", " 1.1 Data Inventory Model We describe the approach to use a relational data model of linking files within datasets within projects. Files, Datasets and Projects in the Ecological Metadata Language (EML) The Ecological Metadata Language (EML) schema is defined by the ‘Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity’ - KNB (https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#tools/eml). A schematic diagram of the EML modules: The figure below shows EML as a hierarchy. An EML document contains a dataset module that allows the grouping of one or more data entities (e.g. a file) linked together by particular rules to form a Data Package. The project module places the dataset that is being documented into its larger research context, and allows multiple related Data Packages to be linked. Motivation/Justification The backend uses a web2py database app, and R helper functions written by Ivan Hanigan There is a need for a data inventory tool to enable ecological data collections to be managed more efficiently The Ecological Metadata Language (EML) provides an excellent standardised schema for metadata, but the associated software Morpho does not have the flexibility or extensibility that would enable a data manager to use it to manage large and heterogeneous data collections KNB is a subproject of Ecoinformatics.org (http://ecoinformatics.org/) an open source collaboration that aims to produce software, systems, and services primarily for the ecological sciences. We apply these to Human Ecology systems too. XML A minimal EML document is summarised below. This is a schematic view that shows the structure of an EML XML document. Only a few of the possible components are included. In the graphic above the mandatory component of the EML is shown as a firm line, in contrast with those aspects of the EML which are not mandatory (dotted lines). That is: dataset title, creator and contact are the only required elements for a valid EML Data Package. &lt;eml&gt; &lt;dataset&gt; &lt;title&gt; &lt;creator&gt; &lt;contact&gt; &lt;project&gt; &lt;title&gt; &lt;personnel&gt; &lt;role&gt; &lt;abstract&gt; &lt;funding&gt; &lt;studyAreaDescription&gt; &lt;designDescription&gt; &lt;relatedProject&gt; &lt;associatedParty&gt; &lt;publisher&gt; &lt;pubDate&gt; &lt;keywords&gt; &lt;abstract&gt; &lt;intellectualright&gt; &lt;methods&gt; &lt;coverage&gt; &lt;dataTable&gt; &lt;entityName&gt; &lt;entityDescription&gt; &lt;physical&gt; &lt;attribute&gt; &lt;additionalMetadata&gt; &lt;additionalLinks&gt; The parts of an EML document In EML, the term dataset is applied to a document which may contain general information such as the title, creator, and contacts, abstract and keywords as well as one or more data entities, such as datatables, that provide more specific research details. The information is at the level of a particular data collection or study, however there is also a level above this at the “project” level where research studies can be grouped together. In EML, the term dataset refers to one or more data entities. However, there is no generally accepted practice on what to include in an EML-dataset document. Some people will choose to have a one-to-one correspondence between an EML document and a data entity and a single physical file. Others will document several data entities in one dataset document. Below is a brief description of the way we interpret the components of an EML dataset Datasets Dataset is the top level of the EML. The miminum necessary to produce a valid EML document is &lt;title&gt;, &lt;creator&gt;, &lt;contract&gt;. But one can’t tell very much with just a title and a name. Our aim is to create an EML document that contains enough information about the data and research to make funding agencies happy and give other ecologists something to work with. Datasets may include one or more data entities such as data tables and spatial images along with associated metadata, but inclusion of data entities are not mandatory. The dataset module enables entities which are linked together to be grouped logically. LTERN groups entities into a single dataset using a range of integrity constraints such as the use of a specific sampling structure or monitoring theme employed over a discrete temporal and geographic range. In the context of the work undertaken by the LTERN Data Portal Team, the term dataset is sometimes used interchangeably with the term data package, however it should be recognised that these are not exactly the same. The dataset module is a part of an EML document which forms the basis for a data package. In EML, the dataset tag contains general information about a dataset; at minimum this must comprise a title, one Data Creator and a contact (often the Data Creator and contact will be the same). Additional information such as abstract, temporal coverage, keywords, geographic coverage and methods are used to provide context for the published or archived data packages. For more information about the general EML descriptions see: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/eml-resource.html For more detailed information about the EML-dataset module see: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/eml-dataset.html Projects The project module is optional, but in many cases highly desirable as this provides an overall description of the larger-scale project or research context with which that dataset is associated. For example it might be an entire Longterm Ecological Research Network (LTER) site, or an individual project at an LTER site. The EML “project” module of the EML enables data packages to be grouped logically together. The project module is primarily used by LTERN to identify the Data Owner and the source of funding. The project module is recursive in that it provides an overall description of the larger-scale project or research context for the specific project with which that data package is associated. Information in the project tag of the EML include detailed descriptions of the aims and objectives of the research, funding sources, personnel and a description of the study area. This module also includes content on the study and sampling design and the methods employed during the research. As an example, a project might comprise an entire Long Term Ecological Research Network (LTERN) plot network or an individual project at an LTERN site. For more information about the EML-dataset module see: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/eml-project.html Data Entity As stated earlier, a dataset consists of one or more data entities, and the most common data entity is a dataTable. A data table is something that looks like a matrix with rows for observations and columns for variables In addition to datatables, people using database applications may also produce a view from a database management system or a storedProcedure that results in data output. People using GIS (geographical information system) applications generate both spatialVector, also referred to as boundary or shape files, and spatialRaster. A spatialRaster is a geo-referenced image usually produced by a camera on a satellite or other remote sensing device. The final kind of data entity is otherEntity. An otherEntity is a data entity that cannot be represented by any of the previously defined data entity structures. A non-geo-referenced photograph is an otherEntity, e.g., a photograph of two different types of butterflies. For more information about types of EML-entities see: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/#N10115 Attributes An attribute or as it is sometime referred to, variable, in this context refers to the name of the column of a datatable For more information about the EML dataTable type (especially its attributes) see: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/eml-dataTable.html#attribute "],["recently-published.html", "1.2 Recently Published", " 1.2 Recently Published Project Dataset Date_Published AWAP_AGCD_GRIDS AGCD_GRIDS_1990_2022 2024-06-18 CTM_GEOS-Chem CTM_GEOS-Chem_wildfire_PM25_Australia_2000_2019 2024-04-24 ABS_data ABS_Suburbs_Localities 2024-01-31 Air_Pollution_Monitoring_Stations_National_RESTRICTED API_for_accessing_NAPMD_National_Air_Pollution_Monitor_Database 2023-11-29 Traffic_counts_Sydney traffic_zenith 2023-11-29 Smoke_Plumes Smoke_Plumes_Perth_2015_2017 2023-11-29 HIA_Health_Impact_Assessments HIA_Aus_PM25_under_WHO_guidelines 2023-11-28 TEMIS_Tropospheric_Emission O3_Multi_Sensor_Reanalysis_MSR2 2023-11-10 Workshops_CAR_RESTRICTED HIA_worshop_2021 2023-11-10 Geoscape Geoscape_2019_noise_collaboration 2023-11-08 "],["abs_customised_for_apmma.html", "2 ABS_customised_for_APMMA", " 2 ABS_customised_for_APMMA metadata_field title ABS_customised_for_APMMA personnel_data_owner Guy Marks|https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8976-8053 project_abstract Collected and customised from ABS data sources for the APMMA project "],["abs_sei_2006_2016.html", "2.1 abs_sei_2006_2016", " 2.1 abs_sei_2006_2016 metadata_field shortname abs_sei_2006_2016 title abs_sei_2006_2016 creator Various contact_email car.data@sydney.edu.au abstract Curated by Cassandra, serves to represent segments of the Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) for utilization within APMMA health modeling.

The ASGS brings all the regions for which the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) publishes statistics within the one framework and will be used by the ABS for the collection and dissemination of geographically classified statistics from the 1 July 2011. It provides a common framework of statistical geography and enables the production of statistics which are comparable and can be spatially integrated. This product, Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Volume 1 - Main Structure and Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (cat no. 1270.0.55.001), is the first in a series of Volumes that will detail the various structures and regions of the ASGS. Its purpose is to outline the conceptual basis of the regions of the Main Structure and the Greater Capital City Statistical Areas and their relationship to each other. This product contains several elements including the ASGS manual, maps, codes and names and the digital boundaries current for the ASGS Edition 2011 (date of effect 1 July 2011). The digital boundaries for Volume 1 of the ASGS are the spatial units for the main structure and the Greater Capital City Statistical Areas. These spatial units are: Mesh Blocks (MB) Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1) Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) Statistical Area Level 3 (SA3) Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (GCCSA) State and Territory (S/T). additional_metadata /home/public_share_data/ResearchData_CAR/Environment_General/ABS_data/ABS_Census_2011 alternate_identifier https://cloud.car-dat.org/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/Environment_General/ABS_data/ABS_Census_2011 associated_party access_rules Access by request.

Assessment of the impacts of air pollution on population health and evaluation of trends relative to other major risk factors requires regularly updated, accurate, spatially resolved exposure estimates. We combined satellite-based estimates, chemical transport model simulations, and ground measurements from 79 different countries to produce global estimates of annual average fine particle (PM2.5) and ozone concentrations at 0.1Â° Ã— 0.1Â° spatial resolution for five-year intervals from 1990 to 2010 and the year 2013. These estimates were applied to assess population-weighted mean concentrations for 1990-2013 for each of 188 countries. (See Environ. Sci.

Instruments used: Multi-channel DustTraks are used for stations reporting TSP, PM10 and PM2.5. Single-channel DustTraks are used for stations reporting TSP only. An ongoing upgrade is underway to replace all NSW sites with multi-channel instruments. Disclaimer: Most rural network stations use mid-cost indicative monitors which respond to all aerosols including dust, sea salt and smoke. Single-channel DustTraks (TSP only) will also respond to fog. Best efforts have been made to ensure that data from these instruments is consistent with measurements from compliance instruments. However, note that instrument accuracy does not meet strict Australian Standards, therefore care must be taken in interpreting the data compared with Air NEPM standards without additional information. Reported data has only undergone preliminary automated checks, and further manual validation is performed for data stored in the DPIE database. Data is reported in Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST).

Cells containing no data indicates that there is no valid data for that specific period Data from TEOM instruments is believed to underestimate PM2.5 due to losses due to volatilisation, care needs to be taken when using this data. These stations were co-located with Partisol equipment so will have overlap with other daily PM2.5 data from VIC EPA, and TEOMs are considered to be more accurate.

This data is disaggregated by SA4/LGA/greater capital city aggregations, state, year, month or date of death, sex, age group and selected causes of death (ICD10 code) for 2000-2019. • Monthly deaths for all causes, non-trauma, suicide, cardiovascular, renal and respiratory (also for subcategories Chronic lower resp diseases, and Influenza and Acute lower resp infections) causes ; by state, GCC, SA4 or LGA, by sex and age group • Daily deaths (GCC) for all-cause and non-trauma, by GCC and age group • Daily deaths for respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal diseases, by GCC Deaths data are provided by the AIHW from the National Mortality Database (unpublished). Cause of Death Unit Record File data are provided to the AIHW by the Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System (managed by the Victorian Department of Justice) and include cause of death coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The data are primarily maintained by the AIHW in the National Mortality Database and aggregated data provided to the CARDAT platform for the ARDC funded Integrated National Air Pollution and Health Data of the Centre for Safe Air (CSA). See https://doi.org/10.47486/PS022 Please read the explanatory notes attached. Aggregations of sex and age group where given are categorised as follows: Sex (Males, Females, Persons); Age group (0-9, 10-29, 30-54, 55-64 , 65-74, 75-84, 85plus). Cause-specific conditions are defined by ICD10 codes: Respiratory diseases (J00-J99), Cardiovascular diseases (G45-G46, I00-I99, R00), Renal diseases (N00-N99), suicide (X60–X84.9, Y87.0) As the LGA and SA4 files are quite large, the rows with zero deaths are removed. The State and GCC files contain all rows of data (including the rows with zero deaths). Deaths from suicide are provided at State and GCC level only, with age groups 0-9 and 10-29 combined. Deaths are counted according to death occurrence, note that some deaths are not registered in the same year that it occurred particularly in November and December (e.g. due to late registration or coronial investigation). Hence, deaths in 2019 are underestimated. Deaths registered in 2017 and earlier are based on the final version of cause of death data; deaths registered in 2018 are based on the revised version; deaths registered in 2019 are based on the preliminary version. Revised and preliminary versions are subject to further revision by the ABS. additional_metadata Access is restricted alternate_identifier https://cloud.car-dat.org/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/ResearchProjects_CAR/Australian_Mortality_AIHW_RESTRICTED/AIHW_Summarised_cause_of_death_2000_2019_disaggregated_version_2 associated_party access_rules HIGHLY RESTRICTED Note that the underlying results are not permissible for publication.

This collection contains validated events of extreme biomass smoke pollution across several major urban centres and smaller regional towns in the Australian States of New South Wales, Western Australia, and Tasmania that are intermittently affected by extreme episodes of biomass smoke. The collection provides researchers with tools that allow them either to add new data, or to use the existing data to study new statistical associations between pollution spikes and health outcomes around those days. Exposure to smoke from biomass burning is a contributor to morbidity and mortality in groups susceptible to the health effects of smoke. Researchers are invited to extend the database with new events or additional data for already identified events.

For more information and access see http://cardat.github.io/data_inventory/bushfire_specific_pm25_aus_2001_2020_v1_3.html. In addition to PM2.5 predictions, a Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS (STL) decomposition was calculated for years 2001-2019, using a seasonal window of 45. Due to the abnormal levels of PM2.5 in January 2020 from severe bushfires, the year 2020 was not included in the STL calculation. However, the decomposition was extrapolated to 2020 using 2019 seasonal and trend values. Flags for classifying days of high PM2.5 (e.g. dust event, bushfire event) were taken from v1.2. As the v1.2 prediction grid was slightly smaller than that of v1.3, an extrapolation was performed on the flags to cover coastal pixels.

The grids show the heating &amp; cooling degree days values across Australia in the form of a two-dimensional array. The mean data are based on the standard 30-year period 1961-1990. Heating and cooling degree days are based on the average daily temperature. The average daily temperature is calculated as follows: [maximum daily temperature + minimum daily temperature] / 2. If the average daily temperature falls below comfort levels, heating is required; and if it is above comfort levels, cooling is required. The heating degree days or cooling degree days are determined by the difference between the average daily temperature and the comfort level temperature. The comfort level values used are 12 and 18 degrees Celsius for heating and 18 and 24 degrees Celsius for cooling. For example, if heating is being considered to a temperature comfort level of 18 degrees, and the average daily temperature for a particular location was 14 degrees, then heating equivalent to 4 degrees (4 heating degree days) would be required to maintain a temperature of 18 degrees for that day. However if the average daily temperature was 20 degrees then no heating would be required, so the number of heating degree days for that day would be zero. If cooling is being considered to a temperature comfort level of 24 degrees, and if the average temperature for a day was 27 degrees, then cooling equivalent to 3 degrees (3 cooling degree days) would be required to maintain a temperature of 24 degrees for that day. However if the average temperature was 21 degrees, then no cooling would be required, so the number of cooling degree days for that day would be zero. Average annual heating and cooling degree days are calculated by adding heating and cooling degree days totals over a specified period (1961 to 1990) and dividing by the number of years in that period (30 years in this case). Similarly, average monthly heating and cooling degree days are calculated by adding monthly totals and dividing by the number of years in the specified period.

Average annual RH is calculated by adding (9am or) 3pm RH values over a specified period (1976 - 2005) and dividing by the number of years in that period (30 years in this case). Similarly, average monthly (9am and) 3pm RH is calculated by adding daily (9am or) 3pm values for a selected month and dividing by the number of years in the specified period. Relative humidity (RH) is an indicator of the moisture content of the air. It is the amount of moisture in the air as a percentage of the amount of moisture the air can contain. Warmer air can contain more moisture than cooler air, which means that for a given amount of atmospheric moisture, RH will be lower if the air is warm and higher if the air is cool. This can be seen by comparing the daily 9am maps (higher RH values) with the daily 3pm maps (lower RH values) for any month of the year. The annual 9am and 3pm RH maps show that RH increases in coastal regions, similar in nature to the distribution of rainfall in the annual rainfall maps. RH tends to be higher in northern Australia due to the wet climate experienced in this region.

The drought method follows that outlined in Watts et al.12 We used the Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) calculated on 6-month timescale. In this report we show that the SPEI can also be used to indicate extremely wet periods that may be associated with flooding (as it was in Eastern Australia during the first three months of 2022). Data We used monthly rainfall and temperatures, calculated using the Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP) gridded data January 1950 - March 2022 at 0.05 × 0.05 degree resolution.11 Methods This indicator represents the area impacted by excess drought events compared to the 1950-2005 baseline. The drought method follows that outlined in Watts et al.12 We used the Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) calculated on 6-month timescale. Due to lack of wind speed data, the potential evapotranspiration (PET) was calculated using the Thornthwaite method rather than the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith method. We used the algorithm provided in the R package “SPEI” (Santiago Beguería and Sergio M. Vicente-Serrano (2017). SPEI: Calculation of the Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index. R package version 1.7. The SPEI is a multiscalar index, which takes into account both precipitation (using the basis of the more commonly used SPI index) and temperature, to estimate potential evapotranspiration.

Data are available in easily accessible GIS-layers and can also be explored online here and a detailed description of the underlying methodology is provided by Andela et al. (2019). The data provide unique insights in the environmental conditions that give rise to the world’s most extreme wildfires. The world’s largest wildfires were found in sparsely populated arid and semiarid grasslands and shrublands of interior Australia, Africa, and Central Asia. Strikingly, fires of these proportions were nearly absent in similar ecosystems of North and South America, possibly due to higher landscape fragmentation and different management practices, including active fire suppression. While the world’s largest fires occurred in more arid ecosystems, the longest fires burned for over 2 months in seasonal regions of the humid tropics and high-latitude forests. In these sparsely populated high fuel-load systems fires can continuously burn if weather conditions are favourable. Abnormal weather conditions often synchronized the occurrence of multiple extreme wildfires across larger regions. Global patterns of fire velocity were reversely related to fuel loads, and the highest fire velocities typically occurred in areas of low fuel loads.

VIIRS ACTIVE FIRE PRODUCTS Each VIIRS active fire/thermal anomaly location represents the centre of a 375m pixel. The VIIRS data complement the MODIS fire detections but the improved spatial resolution of the 375 m data provides a greater response of fires over relatively small areas and has improved nighttime performance. Read more on VIIRS Active Fire products. VIIRS NRT 375 m active fire products are from: Suomi NPP (VNP14IMGTDL_NRT) and NOAA-20, formally known as JPSS-1, (VJ114IMGTDL_NRT). Please note, in an effort to standardise VIIRS file names from Suomi NPP, the short name for VIIRS NRT 375 m product was changed from VNP14IMGT to VNP14IMGTDL_NRT (18 April 2016).

Using the very precise air quality monitors installed around Sydney, along with sophisticated modelling by the collaborators, we are gaining insights that other studies have missed about the lower levels of NO2 exposure. We have been able to produce the best maps so far of air pollution for Sydney, and the scale is down to a hundred metres or so. Previous analysis used scales of several kilometres. These new maps are much closer to the level of detail needed to accurately determine health impacts and plan for the future.

Although a good coverage of traffic counts is available for major roads, minor roads are often assigned a constant daily vehicle flow. This is a problem for exposure estimates as noise predictions are reliant on accurate traffic flow data. Here, we attempt to use network routing (similar to SatNav applications) to identify which minor roads are most commonly used within the road network and assign an importance index accordingly. This can then be used to relate to traffic levels. Reference: Morley, D.W., &amp; Gulliver, J. (2016). Methods to improve traffic flow and noise exposure estimation on minor roads.

The geometry for road and rail lines was based on the centreline of these roads / rail with arbitrary values based on road or rail classification. Eg. 75 dB for freeways and stepping down in 5 dB increments for each drop in road classification. For buildings, the cadastral boundaries that were residential and created a polygon within a few meters or so away from the cadastral line. Then the 2011 Mesh Block and Census data were used. A population estimate was attached to each building based on the volume of the building (ie. building footprint area * the height), as to assign a greater number of people to larger, taller buildings (eg. unit blocks) compared to single dwellings. Then a noise level was calculated for each building for the road lines. These noise levels are based on the noise levels around each building facade and provide not only the maximum noise level at each building, but also an average and minimum noise levels around each building, acknowledging not everyone lives in the loudest room of each house. This data is a based on a crude model with the greatest limitation being the estimated building facade information based on block size and a nominal setback distance to define the footprint. additional_metadata Access is restricted alternate_identifier https://cloud.car-dat.org/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/ResearchProjects_CAR/Noise_Exposure_and_Health associated_party access_rules Restricted Recommended Citation Hinze, B.

For roads, inputs based from mobile device probe counts include traffic volumes, speeds and HGV% for the day, evening and night time periods for all roads including local access streets. Noise barriers as identified by the NSW Department of Roads and Maritime Services also feature. Buildings were sourced from PSMA Australia (release date May 2019), with all features overlaid on to a terrain developed from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission. Noise levels in the form of an LAeq were calculated using the German standard RLS90 for the day (7am to 7pm), evening (7pm to 11pm) and night (11pm to 7am) time periods. At this stage, no verification has been made with this dataset and the German standard. This process is currently underway. Then a noise level was calculated for each facade of each storey for each building for the road lines. These noise levels are based on the noise levels around each building facade and provide not only the maximum noise level at each building, but also an average and minimum noise levels around each building, acknowledging not everyone lives in the loudest room of each house. These data also include the height and number of floors in the buildings. additional_metadata Access is restricted alternate_identifier https://cloud.car-dat.org/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/ResearchProjects_CAR/Noise_Exposure_and_Health/Traffic_Noise_Canterbury_Earlwood_and_Hurlstone_Park associated_party access_rules Restricted.

NSW Health encourages all public water suppliers to regularly report water quality information to their consumers. Water quality information is also published annually in the NSW Department of Industry Water Supply and Sewerage Performance Monitoring Reports. Water quality incidents Occasionally incidents affect drinking water quality. These may include changing source water conditions such as flooding, operational problems, detection of Escherichia coli bacteria and/or blooms of cyanobacteria (blue green algae). The NSW Health response protocols provide guidance on managing physical, chemical and microbiological quality of drinking water and/or treatment failure. Water suppliers in consultation with their local Public Health Unit may issue a boil water alert or other warnings to protect the health of consumers. Water suppliers are responsible for ensuring that consumers are aware of any warnings regarding the safety of drinking water. This can be achieved using a variety of media such as newspapers, radio and social media. Letter drops, warning signs and direct contact with vulnerable populations may also be required.

HVI utilises indicators for exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity to calculate an overall heat vulnerability index. Expressed through the data, a vulnerability of 1 represents a combination of low exposure, low sensitivity and/or high adaptive capacity. A vulnerability of 5 represents high exposure, high sensitivity and/or low adaptive capacity. The calculation of HVI and the inputs to the exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity indicators are explained in the metadata. The HVI data is aggregated to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1) polygon dataset to enable spatial analysis to support local policy and decision making.

The health impacts of heat waves in five regions of New South Wales, Australia: a case-only analysis. International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health, 83(7), 833-842. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00420-010-0534-2 The study focused on five regions in NSW: Sydney East; Sydney West; Gosford- Wyong; Newcastle and Illawarra. Cooler nights in Sydney West and cooler days in Sydney East provided the rationale for dividing Sydney into East and West. Data from Sydney weather stations were used to define two temperature regions (Sydney West and Sydney East) by maximising the ratio of between groups to within- group temperature variance. Statistical local areas (SLA) within Sydney were then assigned to the west and east regions. SLA of residence was used to assign patients to Sydney East, Sydney West, Illawarra, Gosford-Wyong and Newcastle. The average of weather and air pollution observations from all monitoring stations in each region was used. Subsequently Ivan Hanigan based the creation of a new spatial dataset for the Biomass Smoke and Human Health collaboration that included many other cities and towns. That derived dataset contains all the other cities and towns from the biomass smoke and health project, stored at Environment_General/Biomass_Smoke_Validated_Events/biosmoke_spatial/data_provided on the UCRH Q drive. This current Sydney GMR dataset is a subset of that biomass smoke project study regions dataset created by Hanigan, and just shows the Sydney GMR. These data (and the map from Khalaj et al 2010) was also used in the Wilson heat paper: Wilson, L. A. L. A., Gerard Morgan, G., Hanigan, I. C. I. C., Johnston, F. F.

Environmental Health : A Global Access Science Source, 12(1), 98. https://doi.org/10.1186/1476-069X-12-98 In October 2019 Ivan used the SA2s (2016 edition) from the Sydney_Airshed_EPA_NSW dataset (also in this Study_Regions project) to create a new shapefile that grouped the Central and Western Sydney regions into a comparable Western Sydney climate zone, and the Eastern, Northern and Southern Sydney subregions were assigned to the Eastern Sydney climate zone therefore bringing the SA2s into line with the older SLA shapefile.

Traffic control departments of LGAs monitor traffic on local roads. Councils only count for high-ish load roads, not for all roads in their jurisdiction. Each LGA conducts their traffic data collections independently. Each of the LGAs in the region was approached and out of the 15 LGAs, only 5 responded positively by sending through their data. Some LGAs stated that they were not able to extract the data the way we required (en masse). All of the LGAs which responded currently use Metro Count to collect and extract traffic count data. This is a company which provides the hardware and software to compile the data into reports. Metro Count gave us a copy of their software so that we could extract the data ourselves if the LGA was willing to give us the raw files. LGA traffic counts did not seem to be conducted consistently between areas; time periods, types of road, presentation of data differed. Only some provided geocoding. As with RMS data, counts were available only for limited roads and assumptions would need to be made for all other roads. If we had received all the traffic data from LGAs, the process of compiling the data may have taken some weeks and due to the inconsistency between councils, may not have been highly reliable. additional_metadata Access is restricted alternate_identifier https://cloud.car-dat.org/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/ResearchProjects_CAR/Traffic_counts_Sydney/traffic_data_council_and_rms associated_party access_rules The data comes from multiple sources - only the Penrith city council data is restricted for use in air pollution research.

Data includes averages per year and per season (summer, autumn, winter and spring). These data are downloaded from http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/ncc/climate_averages/uv-index/index.jsp?period=a where they are used by BOM to create heat maps of solar radiation. These maps show the average annual, monthly and seasonal values of the UV Index over Australia for the period 1979-2007 under cloud-free conditions at local noon, when the sun is at its highest. These values are also representative of the values expected between 11 am and 1 pm local time (12 pm and 2 pm daylight saving time) under clear skies. The UV Index provides a simple measure of the solar UV radiation level at the earth’s surface and thereby the potential for skin damage. Values can vary from zero upwards - the higher the value the greater the potential for damage to the skin and eye, and the less time it takes for harm to occur. Protective measures need to be taken for UV Index values of 3 or above. The patterns of average monthly clear-sky UV Index largely follow latitude lines with the highest values generally in the north of the continent and the lowest in the south. The Index reaches a peak in January when average values of 11 or more cover virtually all of Australia. These values are clear-sky values only, conditions would otherwise be somewhat tempered by the cloudiness associated with the monsoon in the north. The lowest values occur in June-July where the UV Index averages less than 2 over Tasmania, increasing to almost 8-9 in far northern Australia. It is the varying intensity of solar radiation and ozone throughout the year that mostly accounts for this variation of the UV Index which is evident on the monthly and seasonal maps.

Data created by Geoscience Australia. See http://dx.doi.org/10.4225/25/5539DFE87D895 for more information. Geoscience Australia has the primary role in the delineation of Australia’s domestic and international maritime limits and boundaries. An output of this activity is the development of the Australian Maritime Boundaries (AMB) data. AMB is a GIS data product, replacing Australian Maritime Boundaries 2014 (AMB2014), providing access to the data for Australia’s maritime zones. AMB is a digital representation of Australia’s limits and boundaries as established under the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973 and associated proclamations. The data also include a representation of the limits by which the scheduled and offshore areas of each of the States and of the Northern Territory are determined under the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 (OPGGSA). In the event of an inconsistency between AMB data and the limits under any legislation, the latter prevails. The data have been published by Geoscience Australia in consultation with other relevant Commonwealth Government agencies including the Attorney-General’s Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Australian Hydrographic Office. This version contains a number of technical amendments made on the basis of user feedback. These include: Â· Harmonisation of maritime boundaries, scheduled area and graticular block datasets in block SC51 AMB data comprise the territorial straight baselines and the outer limits of each zone, together with maritime boundaries determined by treaties between Australia and neighbouring countries. All data coordinates are supplied in the GDA94 datum. The data reflects the location of the coastline within the constraints of available source material at the time of production. AMB Data can also be viewed on-line via AMSIS (http://www.ga.gov.au/marine/jurisdiction/amsis.html). Product Specifications Coverage: Australia including all external territories Currency: May 2014. Coordinates: Geographical Datum: GDA94 (functionally equivalent to WGS84). Format: ESRI Geodatabase and REST web service - free online. The area of coverage of the AMB data is for the whole of the Australian marine jurisdiction which includes waters adjacent to the mainland, offshore islands and External Territories. The geographical extent is approximately between the latitude limits of 7 S to 70 S and the longitude limits 40 E to 175 E. additional_metadata /home/public_share_data/ResearchData_CAR/Environment_General/Water_bodies_GA/Australian_maritime_boundaries_2014 alternate_identifier https://cloud.car-dat.org/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/Environment_General/Water_bodies_GA/Australian_maritime_boundaries_2014 associated_party access_rules Access by request.
